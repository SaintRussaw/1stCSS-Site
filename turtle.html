    <li>Turtles can breathe through their butts
Some species, like the Australian Fitzroy River turtle and North American eastern painted turtle, can absorb oxygen through their cloaca—a multi-purpose opening used for excretion and reproduction—especially when underwater during hibernation.

        Their shells are living bone—and part of their spine
A turtle’s shell isn’t just armor; it’s fused to its ribs and spine. That means a turtle can’t crawl out of its shell—it’s a permanent part of their skeleton.

Temperature determines the sex of baby turtles
In many species, warmer nest temperatures produce females, while cooler temperatures produce males. This means climate change could dramatically affect turtle populations by skewing sex ratios.

Some turtles can live without food for months
Turtles have incredibly slow metabolisms. During hibernation or periods of dormancy, certain species can survive for months without eating by slowing down their bodily functions dramatically.

Sea turtles can migrate thousands of miles
Leatherback sea turtles, the largest species, can travel over 10,000 miles a year, crossing entire oceans between feeding and nesting sites, using Earth’s magnetic field to navigate with surprising accuracy.
