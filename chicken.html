    <li>Chickens can remember over 100 faces
Chickens are surprisingly smart—they can recognize and remember over 100 different human and animal faces. They also have social hierarchies (a "pecking order") and can form strong bonds.

    <li>
       Chickens dream just like humans. Chickens experience REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, which suggests they may dream—just like humans do. This shows that they have complex brain activity while resting.

       A mother hen talks to her chicks before they hatch
Hens start clucking softly to their unhatched chicks, and the chicks chirp back through their shells, creating a bond even before birth.   </li>

    <li>
 They have color vision—better than humans
Chickens can see UV light, giving them superior color vision compared to humans. This helps them find food and detect predators more easily.

    <li>
       Chickens are the closest living relatives to the T. rex
Genetically, chickens are more closely related to the Tyrannosaurus rex than any other living animal. Scientists have even studied chicken DNA to better understand dinosaurs!
