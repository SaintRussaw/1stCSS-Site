    <li>They’re the world’s largest rodents
Capybaras can weigh up to 150 pounds (68 kg) and reach over 4 feet in length. They’re essentially giant, chill guinea pigs!

Capybaras are excellent swimmers
With webbed feet and eyes, ears, and noses positioned on top of their heads, capybaras are built for water. They can hold their breath for up to 5 minutes and even sleep submerged with just their noses poking out.

They have a complex social life
Capybaras are highly social animals, living in groups of 10–20, and sometimes even up to 100 during dry seasons. They communicate using a range of vocalizations like purrs, whistles, barks, and squeals.

Capybaras are friends with everyone
They're famously chill and often seen hanging out with other animals—monkeys, ducks, birds, cats, and even crocodiles. Their peaceful nature and calm demeanor make them animal kingdom favorites.

    <li>
 They eat their own poop (for good reason)
Capybaras practice coprophagy—eating their own feces—to help fully digest the plant fibers in their diet. It allows them to absorb maximum nutrients from their food.
