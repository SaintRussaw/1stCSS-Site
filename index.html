    <h1 style="text-align: center;">My Top Five Animals </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Click each image to learn a fact about the animal!</p>

    <h2 class="h2style">1. Dog</h2>
    <a href="./dog.html"><img src="./Images/Pug.png" height="200" alt="Pug"></a>
    <p>Of course, dogs had to be number one. They are just too cool not to be.
        Especially pugs regardless of the hate that they get.

    <h2 class="h2style">2. Turtle</h2>
    <a href="./turtle.html"><img src="./Images/Turtle.png" height="200" alt="turtle"></a>
    <p>The turtle is literally the chilliest animal alive. They just be sitting there
        floating and minding their own business, I don't even see why predators
        even mess with them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2style">3. Chicken</h2>
    <a href="chicken.html"><img src="./Images/Chicken.png" height="200" alt="chicken"></a>
    <p>Not only are they adorable as hell, but they also insanely helpless LOL.
        Like dang y'all really can't do much to defend yall selves huh. Crazy cause 
        Of how adorable they are. But McChicken's go crazy though so it's understandable.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2style">4. Capybara</h2>
    <a href="capybara.html"><img src="./Images/Capybara.png" height="200" alt="Capybara"></a>
    <p>Honestly, was going to be my number one, but I have some bad memories
        associated with this animal, but that doesn't change the fact that they 
        are still adorable as hell. Plus they too get along with everybody 
        this is another animal that I don't understand gets hunted by predators..
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2style">5. Sloth</h2>
    <a href="sloth.html"><img src="./Images/Sloth.png" height="200" alt="Sloth"></a>
    <p>Come on now, who else doesn't love a good sloth? (Besides the bible) </p>
