    <h1>The Sloth</h1>

    <li>Sloths are surprisingly good swimmers
Even though they move slowly on land, sloths are three times faster in water. They can hold their breath for up to 40 minutes by slowing their heart rate dramatically.

    <li>
        They only poop once a week—and it’s risky
Sloths descend from the trees just once a week to poop, which is when they're most vulnerable to predators. Scientists aren’t 100% sure why they take this risk, but some think it has to do with territory marking or fertilizing trees.


    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Their fur is an entire ecosystem
Sloth fur hosts algae, beetles, and moths—turning them into mini jungles! The greenish tint from the algae helps camouflage them in the treetops.

        Sloths have a very low body temperature
Their body temp ranges between 74–92°F (23–33°C), which is low for mammals. They can’t shiver to warm up, so if they get too cold, they risk death from hypothermia.


    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        They can turn their heads 270 degrees
Thanks to extra neck vertebrae, three-toed sloths can rotate their heads almost all the way around, giving them a wide field of view to spot threats or find food—while barely moving.
