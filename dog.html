    <li>Dogs Can smell your emotions- They can detect changes in your scent
        that correspond to feelings like fear, stress, or happiness, thanks to their 
        insanely powerful noses
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        They have a "third eyelid" - Called the nictitating membrane, it helps protect
        their eyes and keep them moist, especially during sleep or when blinking
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Dogs can detect diseases - Some dogs can sniff out cancer, diabetes (blood sugar
        changes), and even COVID-19 with remarkable accuracy
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        A Dog's nose print is unique - Just like human fingerprints, no two dog nose prints
        are alike. Some Kennels even use them for identification.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        They actually have sweat glands - but only in their paws! that's why you might 
        see damp paw prints on a hot day.
    </li>
